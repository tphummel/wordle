[Wordle][3] should be savored. Wordle is fragile. Wordle is worth protecting. Do not break Wordle for others.

[Wordle][3] is an amazing creation. Its technical merits and simplicity are admirable. See [Douglas Vaghetti's writeup][2] enumerating these points. Beyond that, it brings joy to many people every day.

I'm fascinated by the inner workings of Wordle. I want to understand how it works so I can learn why it works so well. Every bit of the source code is public, though minified, so you can poke around inside it to see what makes it tick. In doing so myself I've been very careful when working with the solution list of ~~2315~~ 2309 words. I try to handle it as blindly and minimally as possible. In working on this site, I [spoiled a single puzzle][4] for myself accidentally and it was very sad and disappointing.

Wordle is a daily joy to many and its innards are available for anyone to inspect. This makes Wordle fragile. If your goal is to beat Wordle you will beat it. You can open it up, inspect it, and break it for yourself. It gives you the answers. You barely have to look.

[Several][1] [people][0] have determined what the optimal starting word is. They may share other strategies they backed into after inspecting the solution list. I wasn't able to fully read those articles because it became clear they intended to break Wordle for the reader - so I'm not certain how broken the game is if you apply the strategies they or others share.

If you want to compete at Wordle, you will win. It will be broken and then I suppose you can move on to the next thing.

Wordle is a gift. You can take a 20% lump sum now or you can take annual payments for the next 25 years. I choose the latter. Is "savor" the ideal starting word? I hope I don't accidentally find out today.
