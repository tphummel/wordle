# Intro

Multiplayer contests in which each player uses the same starting word each day. The contest is meant to highlight relative performance with the opening and solution words in common (see: [duplicate bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duplicate_bridge)).

# Rules

## Each Month Contest

- Each contest will be either an agreed upon common starting word or free for all.
  - If common opener: you must play the agreed up starting word to participate on any given day. 
  - If free for all: use any starting word you want each day. It need not be the same word every day of the contest. 

- Hard mode: yes, put your game into "hard mode" in the settings panel before starting your puzzle.
