title: Hashes Played
---

## Intro
This list includes distinct permutations of emoji tiles played in a single puzzle. The starting word and solution need not be identical, just the results. It is an interesting way of finding puzzles whose results are similar. See the similar puzzles section on each individual puzzle page. Example: [Puzzle 524]({{< ref "w/2022-11-25" >}}).

If you're interested in only the opener row of emoji, check out the [Opener Hashes](/openerhash/) taxonomy.

For example, this puzzle:

```
🟨⬛️⬛️🟨🟨
🟨🟨🟨⬛️⬛️
🟩🟩🟩🟩🟩
```

Is encoded as this puzzle hash:

```
PAAPPPPPAACCCCCXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```
