title: Shifts Played
---

## Intro 

This list includes all puzzles played with a distinct solution. I call it "shifts" because I use a Caesar Shift or [Caesar Cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) to avoid handling or exposing the actual solution words. The purpose is to identify and group puzzles which have the same solution. 

The actual cipher I use is to shift the letter at each position by six plus the character position, indexed by zero. Shifting differently by character position prevents exposing duplicate letters if they exist. 

A solution "shift" would be encoded as: "yoqod". 

```
s ->  6 -> y
h ->  7 -> o
i ->  8 -> q
f ->  9 -> o
t -> 10 -> d
```
