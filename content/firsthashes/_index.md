title: First Guess Hashes Played
---

## Intro
This list groups puzzles by the emoji pattern from just the first guess. It works like the full puzzle hash taxonomy but trims the grid down to a single row, producing a five character code using `A` (absent), `P` (present), and `C` (correct).

For example, this opener:

```
⬛️⬛️🟨⬛️⬛️
```

Is encoded as this first guess hash:

```
AAPAA
```
